This issue gives Part 2 of the 39-channel filter bank report, and thus is in a sense paired with the previous issue, EN#115. Note however that this issue is eight pages long instead of 10, while the next issue, EN#117 is 14 pages long instead of 12. The paired mailing of EN#116 and EN#117 is for mailing purposes - the weight is just right. Issues EN#118 and EN#119 will also be paired for mailing, and will arrive soon.


# News and notes

A new publication in the electronic music area is *Synthersource* from Curtis Electromusic, which is now at 110Highland Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95030.  The first issue, Vol. 1, No. 1, has been issued and deals principally with CEM products, including the new CEM3350 dual state-variable filter and the CEM3360 dua VCA.  Also included is an interview with Tom Oberheim.  While the first issue clearly looks more lik a "house organ" for CEM, this in itself is not bad, since you will find in it detailed technical information on the CEM cips.  Also, there is an indication that guture issues will include inforation from the outside.  Issue 1 is 15 pages long, and *Synthersource* plans to publish four times per year for a subscription cost of $12.50.  Worth looking into.


# Reader's Questions




**Q:** In the Preferred Circuits Collection, the sample-and-hold - 2, is a 74COO correct for IC-3, and what are the pin numbers for each connection? I don't understand the top connection to the top NAND gate or the -15 to the bottom gate.

{: refdef}

**A:** The short answer to your question is that any CMOS NAND gate can be used here, and the 74COO is a good choice, or you could also use the type 4011. Both of these take their more positive supply level on pin 14, and
their more negative supply on pin 7. The most common arrangement is +15 on pin 14, and ground on pin 7, but here we wanted the output to swing over a range from ground to -15. Thus we use ground as the most positive voltage (on pin 14) and -15 for the more negative voltage (on pin 7) as shown in the figure at the right. Probably what is confusing is the inclusion of power supply connections in the first place, as these are commonly left off schematic diagrams. Here they are shown because they are not the usual arrangement. A good analogy might be that in writing down musical notation, flats and sharps are put in the key signature, and are understood to be present throughout the piece, unlejis^ cancelled by a natural sign for an individual note. The other thing to keep in mind is that IC's are powered between two voltage levels, and that it is the magnitude and relative polarity of this difference that matters, along with an absolute maximum difference that is allowed. For CMOS, the absolute maximum is 18 volts, so it can't be run between +15 and -15 since this is a difference of 30 volts (you will blow the chip if you try). Thus common levels would be +15 and ground, +7.5 and -7.5, or ground and -15, as in the above example. In particular note that the need to maintain the correct polarity of the supply voltage means that if you want to change from a zero to -15 swing instead of a zero to +15 swing, you do not put -15 on the pin where you formerly had +15 and leave ground the same, but rather you must change both the regular power supply pin and ground.

# A 39-channel Variable-Q Filter Bank (Part 2)

In EN#115, we presented mainly theoretical and construction details of a 39-
channel filter bank. In this issue, we want to follow up a bit with some ideas concerning applications and possible alterations to the bank, and to relate our findings to those of others.

## Applications

It is often the case that a piece of equipment is designed and constructed with
a specific application in mind. Upon completion and initial testing, the designer
frequently will then ask himself if other applications can be found for the device.
This is particularly true if the device is somewhat involved, and if certain design
choices were made somewhat arbitrarily. Here we will be looking at the main application, which is basically that of a formant filter, and then go on to some other
applications or application suggestions.

## Many Channel Formant Filter Bank as an Animator

There is little question in my mind that the main application for this bank
relates rather closely with the idea of animation that we have been pressing for the last couple of years. There is a slight difference however. In the usual animator, we input a static waveform and get out an animated one. In this filter bank, we input a slightly animated waveform
and get out an extremely animated waveform. The basic setup is shown in Fig. 1. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Animator](/assets/EN116/fig1.png)
{: refdef}

Here we drive the filter bank with an excitation e(t), which may be ^T-^__
any arbitrary input. In the case of the Mathews and Kohut work \[1\], *e(t)* is a signal from the string assembly of an experimental violin which is
picked up magnetically, and in Burhan's work \[3\], it is picked up from a clavichord. Many synthesizer users are using this scheme to generate string-like sounds, in which case, *e(t)* is derived from an oscillator. We indicate below *e(t)* in the figure a weak control signal, to indicate that the signal *e(t)* should not be entirely stationary (meaning, usually, a fixed frequency). If you wish, consider *e(t)* to be a VCO that is frequency modulated relatively weakly by the control signal. It might be proper to consider *e(t)* as being *e\[t, p(t)\]*, where *p(t)* is a time varying control on one parameter of *e(t)*.

On the one hand, we can consider the process of Fig. 1 to be that of adding a
formant filter to an excitation, and indeed this seems to be the direction of creation
used by Mathews and Kohut. It is then apparent from their work that our idea of a
formant providing a background (fixed) response,which identifies a note-by-note
passage as originating from a given instrument, has to be revised for formants
consisting of closely spaced and relatively sharp peaks. This is because the peaks
also become apparent in such a case even for variations that are small compared to
usual note-by-note spacings in frequency. In such a case, a vibrato associated with
the excitation eft) is transformed into what Mathews and Kohut call "resonant enhancement", which they ascribe to frequency modulation produced amplitude modulation of
the harmonics of a waveform by the slopes in the filter bank response. This type of
enhancement is certainly what we would call animation under our usual definition of
the animation process. The 39-channel filter bank easily demonstrates this animation.
An interesting experiment is to input a fixed complex waveform such as pulse or sawtooth. If it does not move at all in frequency or shape, the output of the filter
bank is of the same level of interest as the input - no more animated. In fact, all
that we are doing is rearranging the harmonic relative amplitudes, changing one
complex waveform into another. If however, we apply a tiny bit of frequency modulation,
one which we may not even be able to detect at the input, the output will come alive. The minute amount of frequency modulation is transformed into a substantial timbre modulation (variations of tone color).

This effect is real. As long as the input is moving slightly, either intentionally
by parameter control of an oscillator, or unintentionally (?) through the inability of
a player to hold a manual controller exactly constant, this sort of many channel
formant filter will result in animation. While Mathews and Kohut's description of FM
produced AM is intuitively attractive, the mathematics of the processes involved would
indicate an alternative and probably equivalent description, which we have suggested
before \[11\] and which bears a repeat here because our readers have probably been
exposed to the ideas of FM synthesis and will find the difficulties we did with the FM
produced AM model.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Fig2a](/assets/EN116/fig2a.png)
{: refdef}

The FM produced AM model is suggested by Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, and Fig. 2c. In these
figures, the curves represent bandpass response curves. As the Input frequency is
modulated slightly, the output is amplituded modulated according to the response curve.
Since there are in general many input frequency components and many filter peaks, the
various relationships of Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, and Fig. 2c are likely to be present for
different components. Thus, as the frequency rises, some components have an amplitude
that rises with frequency (Fig. 2a), some have an amplitude that falls with frequency
(Fig. 2c), and some have only a small amplitude variation (Fig. 2b, or an equivalent
result in the valley between peaks). Since care has been taken to assure that the
peaks do not line up well with the harmonics of any input frequency, we can understand
how a blend of relative changing harmonics can result at the output.

This model of FM produced AM seems logical, but the reader probably knows that a
frequency component that is modulated in frequency is not really just a single
component anymore, but should be treated as a set of sidebands. In many cases, these
sidebands are too insignificant and/or too close to the main component (FM "Carrier")
to be identified by the ear. It might be supposed that vibrato, being only around
6-7 Hz and shallow would have insignificant sidebands, and that the FM produced AM
model would be valid. A calculation below will show that they are not insignificant,
and will suggest a different way in which the filter bank's operation can be viewed.

At the same time, an equivalence between the models can at least be suggested.
In order to tie our calculations as closely as possible to the situation of
Mathews and Kohut, we will consider a typical violin vibrato \[12\] which has a depth
of about 1/4 tone (peak to peak), a frequency of about 6 Hz, and a starting pitch of
let's say 440 Hz. Now 1/4 tone is half a semitone which is about 6%, so 1/4 tone is
about 3% or about 13 Hz at 440 Hz center. Using standard FM equations \[13\], we see that this gives a frequency deviation AF of half this 13 Hz value or 6.5 Hz, \[The
frequency deviation in the equation is AF Cos 2irfmt so this is a peak-to-peak
variation of 13 Hz.]\ Now, what matters in determining the number of significant
sidebands is the modulation index m = AF/fm, where fm is the modulating frequency.
This fm as we have stated is the vibrato frequency which is about 6- 7 Hz. Thus we
see that the modulation index comes out about m = 1. This is by no means insignificant. The sideband distribution for this case is shown for the carrier (440 Hz)
and for two significant sidebands on each side, spaced at multiples of fm = 6 Hz as
shown in Fig. 3a. \[The third sideband is about 0.02 and the rest are smaller still.\]
The ratio of sideband intensities is about 17 db, and their total spread is about 5%.

Next we need to consider the filter bank with its spacing, which is about 16% for
both Mathews and Kohut, and for our 39-channel bank. Fig. 3b shows a bandpass
response curve that has a center around 452 Hz, a peak-to-valley response ratio of
about 10 db, and the total spread is about ~\6%. Fig. 3b is on the same scale as
Fig. 3a, so we can consider directly the impact of a response as in Fig. 3b on a
distribution of components as in Fig. 3a. It is clear that the effect is far from
insignificant, could be substantial, although it is not totally devistating. In
fact, we can see that the sideband distribution could be spaced nicely along the
upslope or the downslope, thus greatly shifting the "center of gravity" of the sideband distribution. The effects calculated will of course be enhanced if the depth
of vibrato or the peak-to-valley response (Q of the bandpass filters) is increased.

A different interpretation of resonant enhancement is now at hand. We have only
to consider that various relationships between harmonics of an input vibrato signal
(each harmonic has a similar set of sidebands) and the various filter bank peaks can
be expected. Some distributions are sharpened up around the carrier (where the
carrier is near a peak of the response), while others have the sidebands enhanced
(carrier in valley), while still others have their "centers of gravity" shifted
upward or downward. The result is one of beat-like interactions. For example, in
our example, the carrier (440) and the first upper sideband (446) are somewhat
equalized. In other cases, sidebands that are not harmonics of the fundamental may
be the dominant component of a distribution. Thus we might have a beating of the
carrier of one harmonic with the first lower sideband of its second harmonic, the
first upper sideband of its third harmonic, and so on.

The idea of beating sidebands is perhaps not that far from amplitude modulation
as suggested in the FM produced AM model, and we can attempt an equivalence. In the
case suggested above where the 440 and 446 Hz components tend to be equalized and
become dominant, they will beat together with a frequency of 443 Hz pulsating with
a 6 Hz beat. Beating is not complete because the two components are not exactly
equal (and of course, other components are present). Now, the FM produced AM would
also give 6 pulsations per second, and a non-zero low amplitude. Also, according
to the model, the frequency j_s_ changing, and will be louder at higher frequencies
(see Fig. 2a), and thus we might expect some emphasis on frequencies on the high side
of 440 Hz. Finally, AM produces only one pair of sidebands while FM produces many
sidebands. However, the response slope producing the AM is not linear, and this can
account for additional sidebands. Somebody might like to clean this up a bit, and
very likely an exact equivalence can be shown if we go to enough trouble.

All of the above is in the spirit of adding to our intuitive interpretation of
how the filter bank works, since the processing of vibrato signals is probably the
most important application.

## Processing Live Sounds

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fig4.png](/assets/EN116/fig4.png)
{: refdef}

The processing of live sounds is an
application that is open to us and certainly
simple in concept. Fig. 4 shows the setup.
We show a microphone as the input (other
live signal interfaces are of course possible), and the only control available to us is the variable Q, which is the principal added
feature in this design. In the first application, we need variable Q to examine the
effect of using different values of Q, which then remain stationary. Here we have
in mind that the Q control is changed dynamically (and could even be made voltage
controllable with little difficulty).

There is little that we can say about this setup by way of theory.  You just have to try it.  A good test is to connect up a radio and put though different programs.  When the Q is reduced or neutral (negative feedback, or no feedback), the program comes through sounding a bit strange, but not giving what you would call a special effect.  With the Q enhanced (positive feedback), you get quite a change.  In general, sounds are more "ringy" or "tinny" sounding.  Some instruments will sound so different that you will have difficult difficulty identifying them . \[One  listener suggested
that it made Western music sound like Eastern music!\]. Speech is interesting in that
it goes ringing or jumping through various levels of pitch. Singers might find it useful to control the resonance of the bank as they sing, although this has not been
tried.

## Raw Sound Processor

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fig5.png](/assets/EN116/fig5.png)
{: refdef}

Probably you would not care to build the filter bank simply to give yourself a new source of raw sound for synthesis, but it is available for such applications. For example, the setup of Fig. 5 where a noise source
is fed into the filter bank is possibly useful. If
one listens to the output of the filter bank and
compares it to the noise input, they are somewhat
different. If one were to set the bank for high Q,
and listen to any one channel, you would hear a
pitched band of colored noise. The output of the
bank with all channels summed is not pitched, although
it is different from the input.  Apparently, the combination of all pitched bands re-flattens the spectrum enough that it sounds rather white again.  However, of course the pitched noise bands are still there, and can be re-filtered.  This is why the output is a useful raw sound material.  For example, if you filter noise with a sharp voltage-controlled bandpass, you get a continuous pitched output as the filter sweeps.  With the noise first banded by the filter bank, the sweeping filter has discrete pitch jumps, kind of a soothing effect if properly handled.

A second type of raw sound is produced by putting a trigger into the bank and
allowing it to ring all the filters in parallel and then decay. With high Q, you
get a metallic sound, and with lower Q, a somewhat sickening thud!

## Post-Synthesizer Sound Processing

The filter bank can be used on the output of a synthesizer to "pep up" the
final sound. The overall effect is probably closest to reverberation, although
it fs somewhat different from other synthetic reverberation devices. Probably you
should try it if you want to add an "exotic" type of effect to your material, or
if you are trying for a feeling of open space (although a reverberant of tinny effect
is probably best associated with a closed space, for some reason it is often used to
simulate depth in science fiction movies, etc.).

## Alterations

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![fig6.png](/assets/EN116/fig6.png)
{: refdef}

Once alterations are allowed, many new applications come up automatically. The
alteration that comes to mind first is to have a variable frequency feature available,
and this is not really practical in our 39-channel bank, but will be a feature of
other types of banks that we will get to in the next issue.
The easiest type of alteration to make is to add additional output combinations
to the bank, summing different combinations of channels. Some suggestions along these lines have been made previously \[14\], which basically had to do with different
sums to reduce channel density, weight the spectrum in certain areas, etc. In an
overall design, we might consider summing by stages, for example, odd and even
numbered channels could be summed separately, and these could in turn be added to
give the total sum. The advantage would be
that they would still be available separately,
and would give us two choices of half density
banks, and the complementary nature of these
two half banks might yield a useful pseudostereo effect, although this has not been
tried (see Fig. 5). Another possibly interesting partial sum would be to select channels
that are near the formant frequencies of
certain vowels, in an attempt to impart a
singing quality to sounds, and possibly to
achieve a changing vowel sound by cross mixing
two such outputs.

The addition of voltage-controlled Q is an attractive option, and would not seem
particularly difficult. Probably a CA3080 or other OTA could be used to replace
the existing Q control pot. Since this voltage-control Q would probably be used
mainly for enhancement, it could be just an OTA adding positive feedback to a fixed
zero or negative feedback level. A four quadrant multiplier would not be needed,

One can also toy with the idea of having a switch or switches to bring out
selected channels of the bank individually. Such a device would be then useful as
a fixed, variable-Q filter, which is quite a come-down for the full bank, but might
make it useful when the full bank was not otherwise in use.


# Comparison to Other Filter Banks, Old and New

In comparing our results to previous published results [1, 2, 3, 7], we have
offered some new applications possibilities and application ideas that have not been
suggested before, with most previous work being aimed at formant filtering and
spectral alterations (similar to "graphic" equalization). It is also clear that we
have achieved a somewhat higher 0 than other authors have reported. Our bank in
EN#115 shows peak/valley ratios of 17db (Fig. 5 of EN#115 - no feedback), 12db
(Fig. 7 of EN#115 - negative feedback), and 30db (Fig. 8 of EN#115 - positive feedback). Most authors have reported a preference for a level of about lOdb \[1, 3,
7\] for timberal enhancement, and Mathews and Kohut \[1\] report that ratios of from
18db - 24db were judged too resonant, producing a hollow sound. We did not directly
investigate the use of the filter bank for string sound enhancement, but the previous
results seem reasonable to us, and can be achieved with our bank on full negative
feedback. It should be noted that we find a vast subjective difference between a
30db peak/valley ratio (our full positive feedback) and the 17db ratio of no feedback.
The higher resonance at 3Qdb is very evident, although limited mainly for what would
be considered exotic sounds rather than for resonant enhancement to produce more
traditional acoustic type sounds.
It should also be mentioned that the filter banks we have discussed have some
relationship to graphic equalizers variously reported. The main difference is that
with the graphic equalizer the Q of the channels is not so high, but the response
level through the channel is variable with its own control pot. Ian Frtiz \[7\] offers
this with his design, but as a whole, one should not assume that he can examine the
use of the sort of filter bank we have been describing by using a graphic equalizer.
One final point to make here is that this bank, and all similar banks reported
have fixed filter frequencies. \[From time to time, there have been reports of the
use of large numbers of voltage-controlled filters to achieve formant processors,
moving filter banks, or vocoders, but these are isolated due to the large number of
VCF' s involved and the associated expense.\] In a sense, full control over say 40 filter bank channel frequencies is somewhat more that we can expect to control in a
rational manner, so it is questionable even to consider. An intermediate step that
we are working on and will report in EN#116 is a filter bank which does have movable
channel frequencies, but which has all channels moving in response to a single control,
and in a manner that is not well defined. Such a bank offers variable Q and some
motion of filter peaks, and thus may find applications to cases where the input is
stationary. Fixed filter banks in general rely on some small motion of the parameters
of the input sound. The new bank will offer some animation of stationary sounds.
